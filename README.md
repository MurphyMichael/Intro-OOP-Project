# Mean Green Airlines Project

We were tasked with creating Mean Green Airlines management system for Planes and their assigned crew.
The crew included A pilot, co-pilot, and cabin crew memebers. Each employee/crew member were assigned to a plane.
Crew members could not be assigned to different planes if their were already assigned to one, only if their status was set available.
